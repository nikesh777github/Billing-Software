Done:

1. New Customer / product added in create-receipt gets added in DB
2. Bug fixed- New row created for same product is solved
3. When we are adding product or customer or create-receipt, it should open in existing tab not in new tab, give back button to every tab
4. Net Amount should be displayed slightly lower
5. Signature and QR image
6. Selected Business Details should be visible in create-receipt tab
7. Increase Invoice Number if bill generates, invoice number can be different for different businesses
8. Product with blank name shouldn't be allowed to add in bill
9. if we change product values and then select another product, then all values should change to default for that selected product
10. Checkbox to generate same bill twice on same A4 paper
11. if invoice no is not present in record, default 1 should be displayed
12. Increase GST Invoice box font
13. Can change GST% at time of entering product, just press enter after editing HSN
14. Products values keep in center
15. While adding product GST % symbol should not be visible in editable box, show in headline as GST(%) only
16. When adding a product, and try to add same product with updated Qty, new row is added, instead it should replace Qty in existing row
17. if customer name/ product name is blank give popup before generate pdf
Todo:

1. Show HSN values on right side, for customer info n create_receipt page
    e.g.    HSN     GST %
            35035   5%
4. User History > store PDF data, info, amount paid and remaining, etc like graph
5. .exe file for this software
5.1. PDF generate where .exe is installed
6. After editing GST while adding product with float value e.g. 13.9, then calculation is correct,
   but generated pdf shows only 13% instead of 13.9%
7. In manage customer if new customer added then name modified on create receipt then history
   won't ever generates on logs, it creates ne json entry with customer-name as json name
8. On create receipt if we add new customer, even if all fiels are added, still popup
   shows customer name is blank, but generates correct data on pdf, and history generated
9. While adding customer from manage customer uuid becomes json name, while adding customer from
   create-receipt customer name becomes json name

   Expected: If new customer adds from Manage Customer or Create-receipt,
            uuid should be json entry name, not customer name, it is creating
            conflict
